A simple API that will store locations in a EF Database (Currently just using an In Memory DB, no actual DB required) and use them to retrieve the current weather report from Open Meteo

Simpliest way to run is to open the project with Visual Studio and click run, the browser will open to a Swagger page where you can see the different end points

First execute the Setup end point, this will add two test locations to the in memory database, the rest of the end points are standard REST endpoints
